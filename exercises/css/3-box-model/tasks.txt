We've gone ahead and reset all of the styles on regular-band.html, and our job is to get the layout back to a good place!

1. In the regular-band.html, adjust the h1 tag so there's 15px of margin-bottom space between the Open Source Records header and the site navigation.

2. Adjust the h2 tag so there's 15px of margin-top space between the band's name and site navigation.

3. Adjust the h3 tag so there's 15px of margin-top space above the heading text.

4. Adjust the h3 tag again so there's a border-bottom with a value of 1px solid #cccccc.

5. Adjust the ul tag so there's 30px of padding-left and the unordered list item bullets will be visible.

6. Adjust the li tag so there's 5px of margin-bottom and the text in the list items won't be so close together.

7. Finally, adjust the body tag so there's 15px of padding to create space between the edge of the window and all of the other content on the page.
