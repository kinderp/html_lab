We've done a good job structuring the content of our page with the right HTML tags, but the way those tags look is pretty boring right now. Let's start fixing that!

1. In prependers-band.html, write a CSS rule that selects every a tag and removes the underline from the text using the text-decoration property

2. Write a CSS rule that selects every p tag and changes the text color to dimgray.

3. Write a CSS rule that selects only li tags that are children of an ordered list and make their font-size 20px.

4. Write a CSS rule that selects the h2 tag and sets the font-size to 28px.

5. Write a CSS rule that selects all of the h3 tags and sets their font-size to 26px and their color to darkblue.
