We can use class attributes applied to HTML tags so they can be specifically targeted in CSS. Let's organize our HTML and CSS styles with some classes.

1. The site navigation in the prependers-band.html file is a perfect candidate for adding a class. Add a class attribute to the unordered list, and set the name of it to nav.

2. Switch to the main.css file, and set the padding for the .nav selector to 0 in order to remove the space that's appearing before the site navigation.

3. Set the .nav li items to display horizontally with inline instead of their default block-level appearance.

4. The .nav li items are appearing a little too close together. Add 20px of padding-right space so they have some room to breathe.

5. That right padding is being applied to every navigation list item - even the last one on the right, which doesn't need any padding. Use the :last-child pseudo-selector to set the padding-right value to 0 to remove the extra space on the last navigation list item.
